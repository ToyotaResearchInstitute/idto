# Inverse Dynamics Trajectory Optimization for Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control

## Running the Examples

Once you're in the directory where this repository was cloned, just run
```
bazel run //idto/traj_opt/examples:[example_name]
```

Example names include:
- Acrobot (no contact): `acrobot`
- Simple spinner: `spinner`
- Planar hopper: `hopper`
- Mini Cheetah quadruped: `mini_cheetah`
- 2 Jaco Arms rotate a box: `dual_jaco`
- Allegro dextrous hand rotates a sphere: `allegro_hand`

This will run a simulation which can be viewed in a web browser via Meshcat.

## Changing the Examples

The default behavior for most examples it to run a simulation where our IDTO
optimizer is used as a controller. To change the objective or cost function,
perform open loop trajectory optimization, or explore a variety of other
options, refer to the YAML files `traj_opt/examples/[example_name].yaml`.

A few of the examples take additional gflags parameters. For example, you can
add two small hills to the Mini Cheetah example with

```
bazel run //idto/traj_opt/examples:mini_cheetah -- --hills=2
```
